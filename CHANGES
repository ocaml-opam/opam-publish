2.1.0:
* Added an '--output-patch' option to allow use without a Github account
* Use the latest opam libraries (2.1.0~rc) with better format-preserving printing
* Avoid submission of packages without a reachable archive, except if `--force`
  was set or they are `conf` packages

2.0.3:
* Drop Github token generation feature, no longer supported by Github API.
* Use newer `github` library, avoiding warning with deprecated authentication method
* Allow publication of packages without URL (for conf packages)
* Added flag `--no-browser` to disable browser popup
* Fix detection of package names when specifying opam file names on the command-line

* git related fixes:
  * github remote detection
  * `not a git repository` error

2.0.0:
* Switch default branch from 2.0.0 to master

2.0.0~beta:
* Now based on opam 2 libs and intended for publications in the 2.0 format
  (inclusive opam files, etc.)
* Bumped version number to avoid confusion with opam versions
* Removed the two-step operation ("prepare" and "publish"). A single invocation
  does all

  was too complex and counter-intuitive. Now opam files are looked up only in
  the specified directories or archives

  specified directly on the command-line, and repeated for multiple
  publications
